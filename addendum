In college I earned a much lower GPA than it was possible for me to acchieve. This is because I have severe sleep apnea, with which I was not diagnosed with and treated for until after I graduated. Now that I am undergoing continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) therapy, my mood, energy levels, and cognition are leaps and bounds better than they were in college.
Sleep apnea is condition in which breathing stops during sleep. This can result in many negative health outcomes, including stroke [1] and atherosclerosis [2]. In addition to cardiovascular morbidities, sleep apnea also causes cognitive impairment; including problems with executive function, attention, and memory [3]. These deficits overlap with some of of the symptoms of ADHD [4], with which I was diagnosed in college.
